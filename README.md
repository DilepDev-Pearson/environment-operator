The purpose of Environment Operator is to provide a seamless application deployment capability for a given environment within Kubernetes. It can easily hook into existing CI/CD pipeline capabilities including our [CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/pearsontechnology/deployment-pipeline-jenkins-plugin) as well as a typical Jenkins server through a [Jenkins plugin](https://github.com/pearsontechnology/environment-operator-jenkins-plugin).


Each environment (development, staging, production) has itâ€™s own definition and a separate endpoint to perform deployments.

Currently Environment Operator supports Deployments, Services, Ingress and HorizonPodAutoscaler.
We are actively working on Jobs and Stateful sets.



Users of Environment Operator should start with our [User Guide](https://github.com/pearsontechnology/environment-operator/blob/dev/docs/User_Guide.md)



We also provide an [Operations Guide](https://github.com/pearsontechnology/environment-operator/blob/dev/docs/Operatonal_Guide.md) for those deploying and managing Environment Operator itself.
